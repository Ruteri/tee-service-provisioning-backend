// This command-line Go program interacts with the TEE Registry System's Key Management Service (KMS) through two primary commands. The pki command (default) retrieves PKI information for a specified application contract address, outputting JSON-encoded data containing certificate authority, public key, and attestation evidence. The secrets command obtains application secrets using a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and attestation evidence, either from a provided CSR file or by generating a random one. Both commands require an application contract address (--app-addr) and connect to a KMS server (defaulting to localhost:8081). The client is designed to work within the TEE service provisioning backend system, which securely manages cryptographic materials for Trusted Execution Environment instances. For production use, proper attestation evidence should be provided rather than using debug attestation headers.
